title: 2016 Review
---

It's another year-in-review post! I'm not really sure why I keep doing these, but I guess everyone
does so why not?


## Best New Technology Learned

I wrote a rambling post about how I was [cautiously optimistic](/posts/rethinking-another-best-practice/)
about GraphQL shortly after it was released. This year I finally took it for a spin on a project at
work, and so far I've been very impressed. We are using [Apollo](http://dev.apollodata.com/) as our
GraphQL client, and it too has been a real treat. I hope to dive into this a bit more in a future
post, but these two technologies have taken a lot of the pain out of writing network APIs
and building isomorphic/universal web apps.

In other news, I spent some time learning the basics of Haskell, which was certainly a mind-bending
experience. Rather than becoming a proficient Haskell programmer, I wanted to become more
conversant about higher-level functional programming concepts. This year I might try dipping into
OCaml or its new variant [Reason](http://facebook.github.io/reason) to further my journey.


## Open Source

I didn't make many open source contributions this year, but two projects of mine did get some
love. [Envalid](https://github.com/af/envalid), my environment variable validation library, got
a complete rewrite to a much saner API. [apollo-local-query](https://github.com/af/apollo-local-query)
is a new, tiny library to make server rendering with the aforementioned Apollo a bit easier.

I don't have any specific goals for open source this year, but I do have a [skunkworks project](https://github.com/af/slashpile) that I revisit every couple of months. Maybe this year I'll sharpen it into a more "serious" project.


## Best Books

Of the ~40 books I read this year there were five standouts. I don't generally read new
non-programming books so I was surprised that three of them were actually released in 2016.

* [The Martian](https://www.amazon.com/Martian-Andy-Weir/dp/0553418025/)
* [Disrupted](https://www.amazon.com/Disrupted-My-Misadventure-Start-Up-Bubble/dp/0316306088)
* [The Food Lab](https://www.amazon.com/Food-Lab-Cooking-Through-Science/dp/0393081087)
* [The Inner Game of Tennis](https://www.amazon.com/Inner-Game-Tennis-Classic-Performance/dp/0679778314)
* [The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck](https://www.amazon.com/Subtle-Art-Not-Giving-Counterintuitive/dp/0062457713)


## This Blog

My investment in this blog was basically non-existent in 2016, and I'm ok with that. Till next
time!
