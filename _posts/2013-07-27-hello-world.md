title: Hello World
---

So it looks like I actually got around to putting up a personal site. This
is something I’d thought about doing for a couple years, but had never
invested the time to get it off the ground. After a couple of false starts,
I am going to try and publish at least a few things here going forward.

One of the things I asked myself any time I considered setting
up a personal site is *“why”?* I think I finally have a few answers to
that question. First off, working on the web platform for the last 7 years
and still not having any kind of personal online space is a bit embarrassing.
While most of my posts here will probably be software/technology related, the
occasional non-technical article will probably find its way here as well.

A second reason for the site is that I’ve noticed my written communication
skills have really deteriorated over time. I haven’t really written anything longer
than 4 paragraphs since university, and anytime you abandon a skill for that
long, atrophy is inevitable.

Finally, I’m hoping to “reset” the way that I communicate online somewhat. I’ve
used Facebook and Twitter for a few years, and I think writing exclusively in
media of their ilk dulls your brain a bit. After the [shutdown of Google Reader](http://googleblog.blogspot.ca/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html),
there has been small renaissance in feed reader software, so
it’s good to see that people are still interested in life beyond 140 characters.
That’s where I am hoping to spend more of my time online.

So hopefully this has been a reasonable defence of this site’s existence.
I’m sort of re-learning how to write, and trying to find a voice,
so it will probably be ugly for a while. Anyways, this site’s source and posts are
all [open source on github](https://github.com/af/af.github.com) so if you
see anything wrong, or have any suggestions, let me know. If you are interested in
keeping tabs on what I post, an [Atom feed is available](http://aaronfranks.com/atom.xml).
