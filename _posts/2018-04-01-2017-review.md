title: 2017 Review
---

Are you allowed to do a "year in review" blog post when it's already well into ~~February~~ ~~March~~
April? Despite the temptation to sit on this work in progress until August for maximum comedic
effect, here it is, warts and all.


## Most Exciting New Technology

It was [ReasonML](http://facebook.github.io/reason), hands down. Last year I kept close tabs on
this fledgling "language" (it's really just a toolset around the venerable OCaml), and was richly
rewarded. The community is incredibly friendly, and there is so much neat stuff to learn by diving into
a typed functional language. I wrote a [canvas-based game](https://github.com/af/shmup.re), started
working on some (very incomplete) [d3 bindings](https://github.com/af/bs-d3), and am kicking around
a few more small projects for fun. I will definitely be spending a lot more time with Reason this year!


## Best Return on Investment

I previously wrote up [my review](/posts/learnui-design-review/) of the UI design course that
I took early in 2017. While I don't do any design day-to-day, I'm really enjoyed continuing to pick
at this hobby, and dipping back into the course videos and homework from time to time. If you are
an analytically inclined person looking to gain some design skills, I still highly endorse it!


## Best Books

After chewing through 45 books last year, I think might have hit a new personal high score. Looking
through the list, only of few of them were truly exceptional:

* [Deep Work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692/)
* [Flour Water Salt Yeast](https://www.amazon.com/Flour-Water-Salt-Yeast-Fundamentals/dp/160774273X)
* [The War of Art](https://www.amazon.com/War-Art-Through-Creative-Battles/dp/1936891026)
* [Ask The Dust](https://www.amazon.com/Ask-Dust-John-Fante/dp/0060822554)
* [The Brothers Karamazov](https://www.amazon.com/Brothers-Karamazov-Fyodor-Dostoevsky/dp/0374528373)


## Best New Hobby

I started taking to baking bread. *Flour Water Salt Yeast* was inspiring, and breadmaking is
a wonderfully tactile counterpoint to my usual computer-based hobbies. After a half dozen mildly
successful attempts at sourdough, I'm now working on mastering a more basic white bread. The plan is to
work up through pre-ferments and then back to regularly baking sourdough.

Also in the kitchen, I joined the cult of the Instant Pot. I'm only a few months in, but it does
seem like a really useful gadget.


## Best Music

Still going through a bit of a dry spell as far as discovering new music goes. But while going through
Stevie Wonder's [classic period](https://slate.com/cover_story/2016/12/the-greatest-creative-run-in-the-history-of-pop-music.html),
albums, I finally found *Fulfillingness's First Finale*, which is now one of my all-time favourite
records.
