It's my annual year-in-review, note-form brain dump!

## Reading
I read 40 books last year, with the following standouts:

* Refactoring (Martin Fowler)
* Envisioning Information (Edward Tufte)
* The Disaster Artist (Greg Sestero)
* Web Audio API (Boris Smus) [--> read it online for
free](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001552/index.html)
* Blankets (Craig Thompson)
* Jimmy Corrigan (Chris Ware)
* The Innovator's Dilemma (Clayton Christensen)
* Show Me The Numbers (Steven Few)
* Antifragile (Nassim Taleb)
* The Lean Startup (Eric Ries)
* The Wisdom of Anxiety (Alan Watts)


## Music
I was well on track to discover exactly zero new music last year, until
R&B legend D’Angelo came back from the dead to release [Black
Messiah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Messiah_%28album%29) in late December.
While it's definitely not at
[Voodoo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voodoo_(D%27Angelo_album))'s level,
I enjoy the new album, and at least it gave me something fresh to listen to.
Looking forward to actively seeking out new music again in 2015.


## Open Source
In 2014 it was time to learn a few technologies I'd had my eye on for a while:

* [d3](http://d3js.org/), and data visualization in general
* [React.js](http://github.com/facebook/react)
* the Web Audio API

At the end of the year I had a few things to show for my efforts:

* [JSnoX](https://github.com/af/JSnoX), a tool for using React without JSX
* A d3-based [data visualisation](http://aaronfranks.com/openra_chart) for
[OpenRA](http://openra.net)
* Another data visualization for [this site's homepage](http://aaronfranks.com)

I'm also working on a Web Audio-related side project that will hopefully see the
light of day at some point.


## Work
Work was steady for 2014. A highlight was definitely implementing a few data
visualisations with d3 (dataviz was obviously a major theme for the year).


## Travel
Nada.


## Exercise
Very little.


## Misc
So it turns out there wasn't too much to write about (here) for 2014. My life last year
was dominated by non-programming concerns, and was overall pretty damn intense and
stressful. I begin 2015 refreshed, and extremely thankful for a lot of
things in my life. One of my goals for the new year is to write here a little more–
[stay tuned](/atom.xml) for more questionable ramblings.
