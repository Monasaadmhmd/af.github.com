## Travel
* Portland, OR
* Tulum, Mexico
* Los Angeles
* Toronto & Ottawa
* shorter trips to Seattle/Victoria/Whistler

## Exercise
* Ran my first 2 half marathons
* Both completed in under 2 hours, best time 1:49:52
* Can actually do some chin-ups now. Not many, but it's a start

## Music
* Saw jazz legend [Kenny Burrell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Burrell) in concert
* Saw [Avenue Q](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenue_q), which was equally amazing

  [Random Access Memories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_Access_Memories) (album
  of the summer for sure), Michael Kiwanuka, [Tosca](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tosca),
  Mozart’s [Ave Verum Corpus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KUDs8KJc_c),
  and Andrew Mason's equally majestic *Hardly Workin’*

Completed 38 books (not bad). Favourites included:

## Work
* Participated in Warner Brothers’ Media Camp LA program (a great experience!)
* Helped launch a [pilot program of Warner Bros films on Reelhouse](http://variety.com/2013/digital/news/warner-bros-kicks-off-test-in-startup-reelhouses-enhanced-digital-storefront-1200923528/)

## Open Source
* [littledom](https://github.com/af/littledom), a tiny DOM library
* [backprop](https://github.com/af/backprop), for using ES5 properties with Backbone
* [shamus](https://github.com/af/shamus), a work-in-progress desktop app for
  instant feedback during development (using node-webkit).
* Small contributions to about a dozen other projects. It wasn't much, but it was
  something I'd like to build on for 2014.

## Misc
* Finally set up a personal site (this one)
* Learned how to cook beef brisket (easy and delicious!)
* Attended the CascadiaJS javascript conference, which was great


Overall not bad, but there was some personal stuff that put a damper on 2013
for me. Bring on the New Year!
