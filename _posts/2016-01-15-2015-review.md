It’s that time of year again, so here's another self-indulgent reflection on the
last 12 months. I promise to keep it mostly tech-focused this time.


## New Technology for 2015

I can't think of a year in recent memory where I learned so many new technologies.
It’s no exaggeration that my tools of choice are now completely different
than they were just 3 years ago. Of course the rate of churn in the front-end
world has been a frequent topic of lamentation this year, but generally I welcome
all of the great new ideas and libraries that we have to choose from. Here are my
top picks from 2015:

### Redux
Finally, a variant of [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) that just *feels
right*. I love how beautifully simple the APIs are, and there’s a really great
community and ecosystem sprouting up around Redux. Watch the [conference
talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs) on how it came to be, and the
really excellent [tutorial videos](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux).

### ESLint
It seems a lot of people are moving from JSHint to [ESLint](http://eslint.org),
and it’s easy to see why: style checking, pluggable rules, and a really active
ecosystem make it by far the best JavaScript linter going forward.

### Webpack
[Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/) takes a lot of heat (often deserved)
for being a beast to configure, but there really isn’t anything comparable for
transforming and bundling web assets. And once you experience [HMR](https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement.html) for JavaScript and CSS, writing a web app any
other way feels painfully archaic.

### Flexbox
I was definitely playing catch-up on this one, but 2015 was finally the year that
browser support for CSS's Flexbox made its widespread use feasible.
If you write CSS and haven’t jumped in yet, check out [how much easier](https://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/) it’ll make your life.

### Neovim
I moved from Vim to [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) this year as my main
editor, and it has been remarkably stable for such an ambitious young project.
If you use Vim and aren‘t on an Amiga, I definitely recommend switching, if only
for the async command support (check out [Neomake](https://github.com/benekastah/neomake)).

### React-Native
Since November, I have been spending a lot of time with [react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/). While it is still raw in a lot of ways (particularly the docs),
it is already an incredibly powerful platform for building mobile apps. I am constantly
stunned by 


## Books

Looking back on the 39 books I read, there were surprisingly few technical ones
last year. Of the half dozen tech books, [CSS Secrets](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920031123.do) was *by far* the best. If you have some experience with CSS, I very
highly recommend it. There were a few non-technical standouts as well:

* *The Idiot* (Dostoevsky) - Not nearly as good as *Crime & Punishment*, but still worthwhile
* *Zero to Five* - The best parenting book I’ve read so far
* *The Sandman* (the full graphic novel series) - A really impressive piece of work
* *Zen to Done* - Another take on *Getting Things Done*. Still trying to put some
  of its ideas into practice.


## This Blog

One of my goals for the year was to write a few more things on this blog. While
I missed the goal of one entry per month, I eked out [8](/posts), still far above
my usual rate. Though I'm not particularly proud of anything I wrote, I am glad
that I managed to force some pieces out, just to get the practice. There are no
blog-related goals for 2016, so we’ll see what happens.
