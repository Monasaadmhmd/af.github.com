title: 2019 Review
---

Another year, another review post. I'm keeping this one extra simple so I can actually get it out
on time for once.

## Learnings in Technology

I jumped on the TypeScript hype train in 2019 and have been pretty impressed with it so far. After
spending the better parts of 2 years using Flow, it was increasingly feeling like a dead end. By
comparison, TypeScript has a massive (and growing) community, fantastic developer tooling, and
decent documentation.

After tinking with OCaml/Reason for the last few years, I definitely miss [variants](https://v1.realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/variants.html) (TS enums are a pale substitute) and pattern matching. But TS seems to be the most pragmatic typed frontend language around
right now– 80% of the type safety with 20% of the effort required to get up and running with the more ironclad but obscure
alternatives. It's also infinitely more employable, which is a _little bit_ of a bonus.

Another language I spent a little bit of time with in 2019 is Lua. I'd previously messed with it
a bit for use with Hammerspoon, but this year Neovim got first-class Lua support so I've been
playing with it a lot more. Being able to script Vim without VimScript (ugh) or remote plugins is
a treat!

## Reading

At the start of the year I set out a list of 12 books that had been lingering on my shelves
(physical or virtual) for years. Because I impulsively check out a lot of books from the library, it
came down to the last week, but I managed to read them all. In decreasing order of my enjoyment, they were:

* The Enchiridion
* Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain
* High Performance Browser Networking
* Domain Modelling Made Functional
* The Elements of Graphing Data
* Badass: Making Users Awesome
* Getting to Yes
* The C Programming Language
* The Psychology of Computer Programming
* Universal Principles of Design
* Domain Driven Design
* Clean Code

In total I read 59 books, which is pretty solid. Actually, it might be the most I've ever read in a calendar year.
Other standouts read in 2019 included:

* Atomic Habits
* Factfulness
* Why We Sleep
* Digital Minimalism
* The Coddling of the American Mind
* The Attention Merchants
* Siddhartha
* Creative Selection
* The Handmaid's Tale
* Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber


## Music

As I age, I find it progressively more challenging to find new music that resonates with me. So
I was really excited to find [Tiny Desk Concerts](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1B627337ED6F55F0) this year.
The videos cover a wide set of genres, and the artists and sound quality are consistently awesome.
My favourite video so far is [the one featuring Joey Alexander](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NIFz8wRvMs&feature=share),
and I had the good fortune to see him in concert this year. It was the best show I've seen in
years– he melted my face off!

## This site

This personal site got a fresh coat of paint late in the year, and I _almost_ got a real blog post out,
but not quite. With my flagging enthusiasm for posting here and the visceral cringe I get when
reading my old posts, I periodically wonder if keeping this site up is worthwhile. But independent blogs
are a somewhat imperiled medium, and one that I get a lot of value from. I want to do my part, however
tiny, at contributing to the ecosystem. Here's to renewing it for another year!
