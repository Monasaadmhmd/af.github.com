# Obligatory Hello World Post

It lives! Yep, I actually got around to putting up a personal site. It's
something I've thought about doing for a couple years, but have never
quite gotten the ball rolling. Eventually I scrapped my grandiose plans
of writing a custom blog engine and set up a simple Github pages site that
delivered these very words to you.

One of the things I asked myself any time I considered setting
up a personal site is *"why"?* I think I finally have a few answers to
that question. First off, working on the web for the last 7 years and still
not having any kind of personal space online is a bit embarrassing. I'm
hoping I can write up some of the tips that I've come across over time and
make a small contribution to the web dev community. Ideally stuff that
appears here will be occasionally useful to somebody.

A second reason is that I've noticed my written communication skills have
really deteriorated over time. I basically haven't written anything longer
than 4 paragraphs since university, and anytime you abandon a skill for that
long, atrophy is inevitable. Clean, lucid prose can only come from a
well-organized mind, so I'm hoping to improve my thinking skills along the way too.

Finally, I'm not fond of the direction communication on the web has taken in the
last few years. Let's face it, you can only fit so much insight into 140
characters, and Facebook is more about projecting a curated image of yourself
than meaningfully communicating with your friends.
The recently announced [shutdown of Google Reader](http://googleblog.blogspot.ca/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html) might signal a further
shift away from the distributed, longer-form content of blogs to
the centralized, information-poor social networks that are currently in fashion.
By trying to write longer form content on this domain instead,
I want to play a small part in pushing the needle the other way.

So hopefully this has laid out some semi-coherent reasons why this site
exists. I'm kind of re-learning how to write, and trying to find a voice,
so it could be ugly for a while. Anyways, this site's source and posts are
all [open source on github](https://github.com/af/af.github.com) so if you
see anything terribly wrong, let me know. Thanks for reading!
