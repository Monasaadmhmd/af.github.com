title: envalid v4
---

Last week I tagged version 4.0.0 of envalid, a Node library for environment variable validation
that helps you avoid [several environment variable antipatterns](http://aaronfranks.com/posts/env-vars/).
For those who have been using it (and may be wary of a major version bump) I wanted to do a quick
write-up of the notable additions. The backwards-compatible changes are small, but there is some
great stuff in the latest version!

Calling envalid "my" library is no longer accurate, as the last few months have brought contributions from several others. In particular [@SimenB](https://github.com/simenb) contributed most of the new code that culminated in this latest major release 👏. 


## What's not new

I've never really described envalid's features in detail here, but briefly, here are some of the things it handles for you out of the box:

* Allows you to declaratively describe the environment your app expects to run in
* Provides several useful env var validators (number, json, email, etc) so that the plain strings you
  get from `process.env` are converted to a useful format centrally, rather than all across your
  app
* It's super easy to define custom validators if the built-in ones don't cover all the shapes of your data
* Wraps the awesome `dotenv` package, so you can drop your development/testing default values in
  a `.env` file instead of hardcoding them somewhere.
* Handy shorthands `env.isDev`, `env.isProduction`, and `env.isTest` to replace the `if
  (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production')` checks that tend to get strewn about.


## New in v4

Two nice little additions are the use of `prettier` for code formatting and new `host` and `port`
validators. In my experience, hosts and ports are extremely common env vars so it's nice to have
some extra validation baked in for these.

The major (and only breaking) change is to envalid's "strict mode", which gives you some extra guarantees about your validated environment object. In v4, strict mode will throw if you try to set,
or even access, an invalid property on your environment object. If the mistake was a simple typo,
envalid will helpfully suggest a related property that you may have meant.

The following (contrived) example shows how this helps in practice. Note how well it works when
destructuring your env imports– the errors happen at startup time, rather than later on during the
execution of your server route.

```js
// Oops! I forgot a 'T' in there.
// But in v4.x envalid will throw instead of returning `undefined`
const { STRIPE_SECRE_KEY } = require('path/to/my/env/object')

app.get('/customer/info', (req, res) => {
    const stripe = require('stripe')(STRIPE_SECRE_KEY)

    stripe.customers.retrieve(req.user.customerId)
        .then(customer => res.json(customer))
})
```


## The future

It feels like envalid is "mostly done", but I probably would have said the same thing three months ago, before all of the features above landed. It's exciting to see adoption pick up (currently just a shade under 10k monthly downloads) and lots of great community feedback and contributions. Here are a few random ideas I've thought of that might be useful in the future:

* A custom eslint rule to warn when accessing process.env directly – this would in effect force you to access the cleaned env object that you get from envalid.
* Built-in support for designating env vars that are used client-side, and returning a separate
  validated object that you can import from your webpack config.
* Bindings for [Reason](https://reasonml.github.io/)
