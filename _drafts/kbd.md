Philosophy
==========

Any serious craftsman knows his tools well. As a professional programmer,
I find it pretty important to interact with the computer in the most efficient
way that I can. While I’m a long way from realizing that ideal, I’ve made some
incremental improvements in the tools that I use that I thought might be useful
to others. Most of the things that I use are targeted at two concerns: improving
ergonomics and removing modality.


Ergonomics
----------
Being in front of a computer for most of my waking hours means that computer ergonomics are a
pretty important factor in my overall health. The first major implication for me is that mouse
usage has to be kept to a minimum– I’ve found a lot of mouse usage can trigger RSI, and I’m
generally more productive with both hands on the keyboard anyways. Consequently, every
computer automation tool I use is keyboard-driven.

I’ve also started experimenting with DIY standing desks in the last few months, and while
I think it’s an improvement over sitting all day, the verdict is still out for me in terms
of overall health benefits.

Modality
--------
One of my biggest [takeaways][1] from reading Jef Raskin’s [*The Humane Interface*][2] a
few years ago was the peril of modality in computer interfaces. When an interface is modal,
you need to be aware of the computer’s state at all times, since that determines
which actions and commands are available to you. On the other hand, modeless UIs relieve you
of this cognitive burden, and behave consistently no matter what state the application or
computer is in.

One of Raskin’s alternatives to modes is the [quasimode][2], where a user uses deliberate
modifiers in conjunctions with

Applications
============

Remapping Caps Lock with [KeyRemap4MacBook](https://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/index.html.en)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

While using the keyboard most of the time gives some pretty big productivity improvements over
the mouse (at least in my experience), our default QWERTY layout is pretty far from optimal.
I haven’t put in the time to learn [Dvorak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard)
(and might never do so), but have found possibly a bigger productivity gain– repurposing our
useless Caps Lock key. I have no idea how Caps Lock settled in to its prime real estate, but
remapping it to Control opens up many more convenient commands.

You can do this remapping in OS X (System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Modifier Keys), but
